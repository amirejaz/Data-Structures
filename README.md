# Data-Structures
This repo is based on both linear and non-linear data structures:-    <br>

1. Array <br>
  - Traversal
  - Insertion 
  - Deleteion <br>
2. Linked List <br>
  - Traversal
  - Insertion: (At the beginning, At any index, At the end, any node)
  - Deleteion: (At the beginning, in between node, last node, and at any given value) <br>
3. Circular Linked list <br>
  - Traversal 
  - Insertion <br>
4. Doubly Linked List <br>
  - Traversal (Forward and Reverse) <br>
5. Jagged Array <br>
6. Stacks <br>
  - Push and Pop functions
  - Peek Operation
  - Stacks Top and Bottom Operations
  - Stacks using Linked list
  - Stacks using Arrays
  - Multiple Parenthesis
  - Conversions (Infix to Postfix, Postfix to infix, and Prefix to Infix) <br>
7. Queues <br>
  - By Array Implementation
  - Priority Queues <br>
8. Binary Trees <br>
  - Linked Representation
  - Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order) <br>
9. Binary Search Trees <br>
  - Chechking if Tree is BST
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Searching (Iterative and Recursive)
  - Functions (Ascending and Descending order traversels) <br>
10. Graphs <br>
  - Adjency Matrix Representation
  - BFS Traversal
  - DFS Traversal
  - Topological Sorting
  - Dijkistra's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm <br>
11. Hashing  (C and Python) <br>
  - Linear Probing
  - Quadratic Probic <br>
12. Sorting <br>
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Selection Sort <br>
14. Searching    <br>
  - Linear Searching
  - Binary Search
